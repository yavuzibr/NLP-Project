# Orderer of Natural Disaster Communication Informations
Two major earthquakes occurred in Turkey on February 20, 2023. When these events occurred, the entire country came together to provide assistance and information using social media platforms. 
A lot of tweets were made, but a problem arose here: Everyone was sharing and the shared news/calls for help repeated each other. Has the news been shared before, and if so, has help arrived? It was difficult to learn. 
In addition, it was not an easy task to extract necessary information such as address information, location, event, and need from very complex tweets. This inspired me with a project idea. 
"How about if I take the earthquake tweets, extract the necessary information using certain NLP techniques, and keep them in a database? In fact, as a continuation of this project, 
it would be nice to automatically send/notify the information from this database to the necessary places or display it instantly on a website, but as an AI / ML engineer, I don't want to focus on this part for now.
